**Project Lifespan\:** 2016 - Present

The main purpose of this project is to develop a new method of distribution for viewing source localized data.  Previously the company “Cerebral Diagnostics Canada Inc” had a proprietary application called “Dynamic Electrical Cortical Imaging” which was exclusively a Windows OS application. But due to the change in standards of web applications Marcus Gordon and I proposed porting the existing viewer into a more web friendly application for multi-platform access.  I was the sole developer for the source localization algorithm.  This algorithm takes time series of an EEG signal and identifies a vectorized current density 3D representation of the brain activity.
