**Project Lifespan\:** 2014

Identified places in which workflow can be optimized.  I developed various memos and scripts to make it easier for artists to generate posters and movies of the brain.  Following an EEG, recording artists can now analyze the brain to identify key regions and activity to illustrate the most salient brain activity during the recording.  A script was then run to extract these epochs in time and images as well as image stacks were automatically generated which were then streamlined into Adobe Photoshop and Premiere for final adjustments before printing and rendering. I also created various noise reduction recommendations to increase the quality of the poster and movie of the subjectâ€™s brain.
