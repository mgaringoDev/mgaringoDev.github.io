The inconsistency of phoneme generation may have been too large with respect to inter subject variability,  thus, in this pilot study I opted to use whole words instead.  I tried to extend work done by Aushivan et.al, where they found a way to isolate signals with 99% accuracy using imagined words using images of EEGâ€™s rather than the time varying multichannel signal.  I used images generated by 3D EEG source localization techniques along with machine learning to perform the same task but in real-time.
