Fibromylagia syndrome (FM) is a chronic pain disorder characterized by widespread pain that can lead to; sleep disturbance; fatigue and cognitive/affective symptoms. In the past, my researchers have attempted to characterize the disorder using electroencephalographic
(EEG) recordings but have failed to create a meaningful test using mechanical stimulus. This pilot study utilized electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings to investigate the possibility of finding abnormal electrical markers to differentiate fibromylagia sufferers from a controlled group using signal processing and machine learning techniques.  This research is part of a grander study to identify an objective test for FM.  For more information please go to [Tactile Health Website](https://cerebraldiagnostics.com/tactile-health/).
