An analysis of an adult brain state during meditation and aural stimulation through music.  The analysis was achieved using spectral source localization techniques.  The mean energy for a given frequency of each brain state (during the EEG recording of liked and disliked music) was used as a quantitative comparison between the two brain states.  It was found that the delta and alpha frequencies were dominant in both cases but the energy of the liked music was higher.  Though the music appreciation sections of the brain are unique for each individual the study found that most people had an increase in activity in the right frontal-temporal region of the brain.
