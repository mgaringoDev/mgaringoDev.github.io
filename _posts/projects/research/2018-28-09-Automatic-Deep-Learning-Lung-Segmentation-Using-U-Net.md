The main motivation of the this project was to explore the possibility of using a vanilla implemenation of the [U-Net deep learning architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597), as a means of performing automatic lung segmentation of chest x-rays. The idea is that this will be a precusor and a pre-processing step to more advanced techniques of pulminary disease  classification.  The dataset used here was provided by the [Radiological Society of North America](http://www.rsna.org/).  It consisted of over 25000 patients half of which were controls and the other were of either pneumonia and other unknown symptom.  A sample output can be seen below.
