This is the culmination of a multi year project demonstrating EEG source localization with still images and brain movies can be an innovation in front line clinical sleep medicine.  I took part in the creation of many chapters and appendices dealing with various technical entries associated with signal processing, image analysis, algorithm creation and software development. I also developed new sleep analysis tools and  contributed to current  scientific knowledge in sleep research.  For the book and more details about the  scientific contribution please go to [the poster](https://goo.gl/wNymq7) and [the book](https://www.amazon.ca/Atlas-Electrical-Generators-Sleep-Doidge-ebook/dp/B07F1H685J ).
