The purpose of this study was to  identify the origins of epileptic seizures in children.  My approach was to develop a model which incorporates source localized EEG current density vectors,  frequency (through continuous wavelet transform) and the anatomical location.  These three features generate a third order tensor with each node corresponding to a feature.  In theory, this can be used for both seizure localization and seizure recognition, but for the purpose of this project I only investigated seizure localization.  Though inconclusive due to the small number of patient samples, we demonstrated that tensor analysis and Parallel Factor Analysis can be used as a means of identifying complex structures of an epileptic seizure.
