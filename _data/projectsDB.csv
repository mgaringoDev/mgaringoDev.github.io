Business,StartUps,Neuroscience to Education,N2E,2015-04-05,2015 - 2016,"N2E was a software company that created a real-time cognitive assessment software application embedded in video games, providing recommendations to parents for their child.  Based on cognitive neuroscience and advanced statistical and machine learning methods, N2E designed video games without interfering with the entertainment purpose of the game for children (6-10 years). N2E performs real-time cognitive assessments while the children are playing the video games and provides recommendations to parents about their child’s cognitive development and appropriate educational programs to improve on specific areas. I developed the video and machine learning backend to provide recommendations based on various conditions specified by current and upcoming research on child development.

As the Chief Scientific Officer, I solely created the algorithm for the basis of the tools and discrimination processes of the company. I’ve also attended various conferences as a presenter to showcase our technology to both clinicians and engineers.

SoftwareDevelopment,Visualization,Educational Brain Atlas Using Source Localization Technique,BrainAtlas,2014-01-05,2014,"Using the source localization brain atlas algorithm I developed an educational brain map of the anatomical locations of the brain as it pertains to a voxelized version of the cortex.  The anatomical regions consisted of Brodmann areas, and the minor and major anatomies of the brain.  Each voxel of the brain was associated with a 0.5 cubic millimeter of the cortex of the brain.  A new color mapping algorithm was developed to segment the brain such that no two brain regions have the same or very similar colour scheme.  This was achieved by adding a constraint function to maximize the distance of two adjacent brain region colours in the colour space.  <a href = ""http://portraitofyourmind.com/pages/education/ "">http://portraitofyourmind.com/pages/education/ </a>",softwareDevelopment,../../../assets/img/projects/softwareDevelopment/BrainAtlas.jpg
SoftwareDevelopment,Visualization,Responsive Brain Holograms,BrainHolograms,2015-11-23,2015,"The main purpose of the project was to utilize digital holography to enhance spatial features of the cortex which is often limited to 2D imagery. I led the scientific and research team and we developed and identified a workflow to merge the two technologies together in a seamless and coherent manner, while minimizing the change in workflow of each imaging modality. This involved developing a unique predistortion 3D transformation from a biomedical time series signal into artificial holographic projection data.  We were successful in accurately translating source localized EEG signals into two distinct holographic processes (STM Holographic technology and PHASE Research Group technology).

SoftwareDevelopment,Visualization,WebGL Viewer for EEG Source Localization,WebGL,2016-05-29,2016 - Present,"The main purpose of this project is to develop a new method of distribution for viewing source localized data.  Previously the company “Cerebral Diagnostics Canada Inc” had a proprietary application called “Dynamic Electrical Cortical Imaging” which was exclusively a Windows OS application. But due to the change in standards of web applications Marcus Gordon and I proposed porting the existing viewer into a more web friendly application for multi-platform access.  I was the sole developer for the source localization algorithm.  This algorithm takes time series of an EEG signal and identifies a vectorized current density 3D representation of the brain activity.

SoftwareDevelopment,Visualization,Medical Holography,MedicalHolography,2016-10-13,2016 - Present,"A multiphase research project in which we extend work achieved in 2015 of Responsive Brain Holograms project into a broad range of medical applications.  Currently in the first phase of the project, we are trying to identify various techniques of accomplishing this task.  A point cloud to mesh to geometry seems promising but redundancy of geometry recreation is not ideal due to time constraints. I am currently trying to develop a modified camera model to be applied in the image domain in which a given pixel is then transformed into a hogol (holographic pixel).",softwareDevelopment,../../../assets/img/projects/softwareDevelopment/MedicalHolography.jpg
SoftwareDevelopment,OptimizationofWorkflow,Developed Standardization of Poster and Movie Generation for Portrait of Your Mind,MovieGenerationPOYM,2014-03-24,2014,"Identified places in which workflow can be optimized.  I developed various memos and scripts to make it easier for artists to generate posters and movies of the brain.  Following an EEG, recording artists can now analyze the brain to identify key regions and activity to illustrate the most salient brain activity during the recording.  A script was then run to extract these epochs in time and images as well as image stacks were automatically generated which were then streamlined into Adobe Photoshop and Premiere for final adjustments before printing and rendering. I also created various noise reduction recommendations to increase the quality of the poster and movie of the subject’s brain. <a href = ""http://portraitofyourmind.com/ "">http://portraitofyourmind.com/ </a>",softwareDevelopment,../../../assets/img/projects/softwareDevelopment/MovieGenerationPOYM.jpg
SoftwareDevelopment,OptimizationofWorkflow,Developed Automated Extraction of Information of Forms for Travel Vaccine Clinic,InformationTVC,2014-07-12,2014,"Optimized the extraction of information  from the patient forms of a travel clinic.  Employees had to do manual data entry of a filled out patient form into the database which was very time consuming.  I developed a form in which patients can digitally and securely fill out their information.  Once completed, information is sent to a database and can easily be data mined and exported or merged to other databases.",softwareDevelopment,../../../assets/img/projects/softwareDevelopment/InformationTVC.jpg
Research,Auscultation,A Collaborative Pilot Study with Stanford University for Autonomous Patient Medical Adherence Monitoring for Asthma ,Auscultation,2013-09-06,2013 - 2015,"The main objective of the project was to passively detect patient adherence to puffer intake through an app that automatically detects when a subject uses their inhaler .  The theory was that if you are able to inform the patient that they are not properly using their inhaler at certain times, you can decrease the amount of asthma attacks.

Research,EEG Meditation,EEG Brain State Analysis Listening to Music During Meditation,BrainStateMusicMeditation,2013-10-25,2015,An analysis of an adult brain state during meditation and aural stimulation through music.  The analysis was achieved using spectral source localization techniques.  The mean energy for a given frequency of each brain state (during the EEG recording of liked and disliked music) was used as a quantitative comparison between the two brain states.  It was found that the delta and alpha frequencies were dominant in both cases but the energy of the liked music was higher.  Though the music appreciation sections of the brain are unique for each individual the study found that most people had an increase in activity in the right frontal-temporal region of the brain.,research,../../../assets/img/projects/research/BrainStateMusicMeditation.jpg
Research,EEG BrainComputerInterface,Listen To Your Mind,BrainStethoscope,2012-10-20,2012,"The main purpose of the project was to explore the benefits of EEG sonification.  Note that this is not audification which is a direct mapping to the auditory domain, but rather generating a unique mapping system to enhance specific features of EEG to be mapped into the auditory domain.  This was to allow both clinicians and patients to detect abnormalities in their brain activity when listening to their EEG signals.  Though this project’s  primary goal was to develop an EEG system for sleep staging, one can extend the knowledge base into a wide range of applications,   such as measurement of brain states, higher mental function, as well as pain and sensory loss.   The success of the project led to it becoming a module of the proprietary program DECI of “Cerebral Diagnostics Canada Inc” as a real-time auditory display of the electrical brain waves generated in advanced sleep medicine.   It was also used in the Western Hospital Sleep clinic for a sleep recording.  This project also won the innovation award at the International Conference for Up and Coming Engineers 2012.

Research,EEG Epilepsy Seizure,A Pilot Study of Epilepsy Seizure Structure Using Tensor Analysis and Source Localization with Sick Kids Hospital,Seizure,2014-06-16,2014,"The purpose of this study was to  identify the origins of epileptic seizures in children.  My approach was to develop a model which incorporates source localized EEG current density vectors,  frequency (through continuous wavelet transform) and the anatomical location.  These three features generate a third order tensor with each node corresponding to a feature.  In theory, this can be used for both seizure localization and seizure recognition, but for the purpose of this project I only investigated seizure localization.  Though inconclusive due to the small number of patient samples, we demonstrated that tensor analysis and Parallel Factor Analysis can be used as a means of identifying complex structures of an epileptic seizure.",research,../../../assets/img/projects/research/Seizure.jpg
Research,EEG Alzheimers,An EEG Based Diagnosis for Alzheimers,Alzheimers,2015-10-18,2015 - Present,"The  primary goal of this project was to develop a pipeline through which a patient can be diagnosed with Alzheimer's.  I contributed in the creation of the experimental protocol including screening and recording software by applying past protocols of various experiments found in the literature.   I also applied for IRB ethics approval as well as HIPPA and PHIPA compliant server end encryption for patient data distribution to collaborators.  Furthermore, I solely created an algorithm which extracted temporal and spatial features of a patient’s EEG and performed classification using a neural network and linear support vector machine. The novelty of this work came about through the use of EEG source localization as a basis of obtaining temporal, spatial and frequency information, along with a myriad of brain network analysis, to try and explain the underlying mechanisms of the Alzheimer's brain state.

Research,EEG Fibromyalgia,An EEG Based Predictive Model for Fibromyalgia,Fibromyalgia,2013-10-12,2013 - 2016,The main goal of the project was to identify the underlying causes of fibromyalgia under the evoked related potential paradigm using advanced signal processing techniques and machine learning algorithms.  Patients were given precise weighted stimulations and their EEG’s were recorded.  Various averaging and feature extraction methods were applied such as magnitude and phase coherence  analysis to identify event-related desynchronization (ERD) or event-related synchronization (ERS). EEG source localization methods were also used to identify spatial information for anatomical analysis.  Neural network and support vector clustering was performed to identify clustering as well as  discrimination between patient and normal control group.,research,../../../assets/img/projects/research/Fibromyalgia.jpg
Research,EEG SourceLocalization,The Atlas of the Generators of Sleep,SleepAtlas,2015-08-21,2015 - 2018,"This is the culmination of a multi year project demonstrating EEG source localization with still images and brain movies can be an innovation in front line clinical sleep medicine.  I took part in the creation of many chapters and appendices dealing with various technical entries associated with signal processing, image analysis, algorithm creation and software development. I also developed new sleep analysis tools and  contributed to current  scientific knowledge in sleep research.

Research,EEG SourceLocalization,Helped Develop a Non-Parametric Spatiotemporal Clustering of Time-Varying Current Density Vectors in the Cerebral Cortex,Clustering,2012-06-06,2012,"I led a group of mathematicians and engineers to find an algorithm to solve a problem often encountered in source localization of MEG and EEG signals, which is the interpretation of electromagnetic fields inferred by these algorithms.  An algorithm was developed to automatically and dynamically identify temporal and spatial clustering within these fields.  Work by Nunez suggest that various electrical fields are associated with cognitive activity.  Therefore, one can identify abnormalities, brain functions and cognitive patterns using source localization of EEG and our new algorithm.

Research,EEG BrainComputerInterface,Pilot Study of EEG Motor Movement and Imagery Analysis Using Source Localization,BCIMotor,2015-05-25,2015,"An EEG source localization analysis of a 64-channel EEG motor movement and imagery recording consisting of 64 subjects with 14 experimental tasks.  These tasks include the baseline eyes open and eyes closed brain states as well as the typical motor movement and imagery paradigm. Subjects were told to physically move their fists and feet and also imagine them performing those tasks.  Using 3D mean spectral source localization techniques, I identified that left and right brain regions were significantly different in all 14 experimental tasks.  Based on current research, one would suspect event related desynchronization (ERD) to occur, but I did not find this to be the case with our experimental group.  One significant finding from this study was the identification of the brain regions which correspond to the wrist area on the left brain for controlling the right wrist.",research,../../../assets/img/projects/research/BCIMotor.jpg
Research,EEG BrainComputerInterface,A Collaborative Pilot Study with Algoma University for Phoneme Detection Using EEG Auditory Evoked Potentials,P300,2015-08-14,2015,"The main purpose of the study was to create a foundation for future work in the field of BCI, specifically in the language decoding areas.  I used the typical AEP paradigm.  However, I did not follow the typical P300 analysis in which analysis is made 300ms after the stimulus.  Rather I looked at the time at which the stimulus was applied and when the brain reacted to it.  The analysis was not for classification purposes but instead to try and understand the underlying cause or network pattern for when a person is thinking or trying to identify a heard phoneme.  To achieve this I used the algorithm I helped develop at the Fields Institute.  <a href=""https://www.fields.utoronto.ca/programs/scientific/11-12/inverseprob/IPSW/problems.html "">https://www.fields.utoronto.ca/programs/scientific/11-12/inverseprob/IPSW/problems.html </a>.  I observed clustering of electrical activity using the “clustering algorithm” in various brain regions during this short epoch.  The results were inconclusive as some patients had very high source localized activity in the right uncus migrating to the right inferior temporal gyrus, while others had a combination of the precentral, postcentral, and superior parietal lobule.

Research,EEG BrainComputerInterface,A Collaborative Pilot Study with Algoma University for Word Detection Using EEG Auditory Evoked Potentials,WordDetection,2016-09-15,2016 - Present,"The inconsistency of phoneme generation may have been too large with respect to inter subject variability,  thus, in this pilot study I opted to use whole words instead.  I tried to extend work done by Aushivan et.al, where they found a way to isolate signals with 99% accuracy using imagined words using images of EEG’s rather than the time varying multichannel signal.  I used images generated by 3D EEG source localization techniques along with machine learning to perform the same task but in real-time.",research,../../../assets/img/projects/research/WordDetection.jpg
Research,EEG BrainComputerInterface,A collaboration with Sheridan University To Create A Portable 19-Channel EEG Cap Including Amplifier,CapProject,2015-10-11,2015 - 2017,"There is a need to create a portable EEG cap that is safe and affordable and a module to extract EEG signals in a non clinical setting that can be used long term.  Therefore, the goal of this project was to use pre-existing technology to develop a wireless EEG for long term EEG monitoring in the real world setting using WiFi.  With the help of Dr.Ma, I led a team of 4 students to facilitate a prototype of the EEG amplifier and cap.  I was in charge of making sure the design of the cap coincided with the standard 10/20 system and choose appropriate materials for the cap for easy cleaning and storing.  I was also in charge of making sure the amplifier designed matched with the standard sampling rate, noise reduction, amplification and impedance tolerance.   The novel approach was to develop a compressed sensing based sampling rate such that the incoming signal can be as small as possible and that can also simultaneously reduce noise and extract meaningful information.",research,../../../assets/img/projects/research/CapProject.jpg
Research,EEG Pre-Processing,EEG Artifact Rejection and Noise Reduction Algorithms,PreProcessing,2014-05-11,2014,"EEG is considered to have a very high signal to noise ratio (SNR), and as such we need to develop tools to minimize or remove noise. I implemented and designed many EEG noise reduction techniques as new modules and supporting scripts for the proritetry program of Cerebral Diagnostics Canada Inc. This includes the utilization of the following algorithms: Independent component analysis for eye blink removal, cumulative baseline removal, wavelet decomposition thresholding for muscle artifact rejection, matrix generation for removal of paired electrodes in the EEG source localization algorithm, Empirical Mode Decomposition thresholding for muscle artifact rejection, and notch filtering.",research,../../../assets/img/projects/research/PreProcessing.jpg
