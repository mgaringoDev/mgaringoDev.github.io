Past Employment
----------

2015-2016
:   **Programmer** 
:   **_University Health Network (UHN)_**

    Developed mobile apps for android and OS, as well as various web applications. These included creating a
    medical adherance app in which patient adherenace were tracked and automatic reports were sent to doctors.

2013-2014
:   **TEACHER ASSISTANT** 
:   **_Introduction to Biomedical Signal Processing_**

    Developed lessons, tests, and quizzes for the tutorials. Implemented lab work which dealt with physiological data such as ECG, EEG and EMG. Taught class about EEG source localization and its benefits to brain computer interface using both sourced and non-sorced localized data.

2011-2013
:   **INSTRUCTOR** 
:   **_Real Programming For Kids_**

    Taught children ages 7-15 about the fundamentals and good programming practices of computer
    programming using C++, C#, Java and Visual Basics. Helped them develop computer games based on
    the knowledge gained in the course. Communicated effectively by using simple and clear terminology to
    explain complex terms.

2011-2013
:   **RESEARCH ASSISTANT** 
:   **_Colours Without Borders_**

    Used C to acquire data from a device called the i1 pro to acquire colour information of a given colour
    bar. Analyzed raw spectrum of colour bar and successfully classified individual colours within a colour
    bar. Used C++ to create a graphical user interface(GUI) for pressman operators to maintain standard
    consistent colours within a printing job based on expected colour bar information and acquired colour bar
    information. The GUI communicated to a local and web server via SQL lite, to monitor the progression of
    a printing job.


2010-2011
:   **RESEARCH ASSISTANT** 
:   **_Signal Analysis Research Group_**

    Used MATLAB to analyze spectrum and power densities of various EEG signals. Researched and developed
    algorithms to efficiently perform analysis. Used intelligent system classification techniques to group similar
    EEG signals. Developed a GUI in C# and MATLAB to perform different algorithms on EEG signals.
    Presented work and findings in weekly conference meetings.
