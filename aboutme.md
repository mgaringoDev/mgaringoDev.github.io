# About Me

## Objective
My expertise lie in the analysis of various biological, acoustic and image signals. Though very knowledgeable in machine learning techniques my skill set is primarily honed in extracting meaningful information from various time series signals. My philosophy is understanding the underlying cause of the problem rather than creating a block box approach to solving it.

## What I Do?
I use both signal processing and machine learning techniques along with engineering methods to extract meaningful and insightful information from various types of structured and unstructured time serious data, using data-driven techniques to characterize and differentiate different groups or sub-groups within the data.
